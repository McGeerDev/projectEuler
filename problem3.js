// The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

// What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?
//
// Prime factor: Num = x * y * z... where x and y and z are prime numbers;
// This means num % x == 0 : true
// How to check for prime numbers? Divide by self and 1;

// Solution 1 was to push at every point where the outer number modulo the inner number is equal to 0;
// but there are numbers with multiple 0 remainders.

// This is the first rendition of the answer and should be improved as it is very slow and inefficient.

let primeFactors = (num) => { // Divide from the smallest factor, getting larger until the division equals 1. This is the biggest factor
